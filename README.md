# Regression Model Prediction Exercise

This repository provides an exercise to build a regression model, fit it on sample data, make predictions based on input from a CSV file (`areas.csv`), and save the predictions to a new file (`predictions.csv`).

## Overview

In this exercise I took the following steps:
1. Load input data from `homeprices.csv` .
2. Train a regression model to make predictions based on the provided data.
3. predict for new areas from `areas.csv`
4. Save the predictions to a new CSV file, `predictions.csv`.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Input and Output Files

- **Input**: `areas.csv`
  - This file contains a single column of feature values 
- **Output**: `predictions.csv`
  - After running the script, this file will contain the predictions generated by the model.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Isaac-Jim/Houseprice_Prediciton.git

   cd  Houseprice_Prediciton

   ```

2. Place your `homeprices.csv and areas.csv` files in the same directory as the script. Make sure it has the appropriate format.

3. Run the script to train the model, make predictions, and save the output.
